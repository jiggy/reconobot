This is a simple reddit bot designed to grab the BLS employment situation report issued
on the first Friday of every month and post it to http://www.reddit.com/r/economics with
key indicators highlighted in the headline. The app is deployed to google app engine to be
run on a cron.

See here as an example: http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1uvow3/bls_report_participation_rate_02_to_628/

You'll need:
 * Python 2.7 - http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
 * Google App Engine SDK for Python - https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python
 * pip - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
 * virtualenv is optional since all libs go in the project folder anyway

Run the following from project dir:

pip install -r .\requirements.txt --target=./lib
/path/to/appengine/dev_appserver.py .

NB: This app has only run once thus far and it was run manually. App engine deployment is still work in 
progress.
